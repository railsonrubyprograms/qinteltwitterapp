This is my Twitter application for the Qintel Developer Interview Project

The application is written in Python 2.7 and uses python-twitter to interact
with the Twitter API. 

python-twitter can be installed here: https://github.com/bear/python-twitter

To run the program, in Terminal, navigate to folder containing twitterapp.py.
Then in python interpreter, run execfile("twitterapp.py"). Next, just enter
"runTwitter()" to start the application.
